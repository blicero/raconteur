An audio book and podcast player

The big point is that I wanted a way to play audio books and podcasts
and have the player keep track of what file and position I last
stopped playing and resumes from there.

Playing audio directly from within the application appeared to involve
a lot of work, so I am delegating that to
[https://audacious-media-player.org/](audacious), but I still consider
playing audio myself a long term goal.

## Dependencies

* Go 1.18 or newer
* [https://audacious-media-player.org/](audacious), obviously. My
  developments system has version 4.3.1 installed, I have not yet
  tested how it works with other versions and consider that not a
  priority for now. Any feedback is welcome, though.
